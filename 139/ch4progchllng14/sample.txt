Hello,
This is the fall semester of 2010. This class is CSIS130.
This is Chapter 4 Programming Challenge #14.
More stuff should go here.
This is just a test of how the program should print.
It should print each line followed by the corresponding line number and semicolon.
Let's see if I did this right.
