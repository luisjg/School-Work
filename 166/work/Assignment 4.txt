4) No, there are no circumstances when Next_Address is 0x1FF and use the JMPC since Next_Address must be 0x000 or 0x100 when JMPC is used.

6) i=k+n+s;

   Method 1   Method 2

    poptwo4 MAR=SP=SP-1;rd
    poptwo5
    poptwo6 TOS=MDR; goto Main1

15 a) The arithmatetic equivalent is diving by 2
